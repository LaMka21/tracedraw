//! The Distort tool: Push and Pull, Zipper and Twister as a live effect
//! (`Effect::Distort`, formulas in `tracedraw_core::distort`).
//!
//! A drag on an object, or anywhere with one object selected, distorts
//! it about the point the drag started on (off the object too, #1442):
//! Push and Pull by the drag's length, a full half width of the object
//! being 100, pushed when the pointer is right of the start and pulled
//! when left; Zipper with teeth a quarter of the drag's length high,
//! leaning the way the drag goes from the outline's normal (#1671);
//! Twister by the angle the pointer turned about the start, whole turns
//! included. The handle line goes from the start to the pointer in any
//! direction, not along an axis (#1442, `HandleLine`). A selected
//! distortion shows its handles: the centre (a diamond, dragged to move
//! it), a line to the end handle (a square whose distance from the
//! centre is the Push and Pull amount or the Zipper amplitude, the
//! Zipper's line leaning with its teeth; a circle whose angle about the
//! centre is the Twister angle, whole turns counted while it is dragged
//! round) and, for the Zipper, a slider on the line for the frequency
//! (#1122). Each drag is one undo step; a
//! drag off the handles adds a new distortion over the ones the object
//! has, the handles and the bar edit the newest (#1442).
//!
//! The property bar shows the selected object's distortion (or the
//! tool's settings) and edits the selected distortions live.
