//! Effects and Patterns: hatching lines, grids, puzzles, circle fills, cast shadows and random copies.
//!
//! Pure geometry over page-space outlines in millimetres, y up. The
//! application turns the results into commands
//! (`apps/tracedraw/src/signcut_fx.rs`).
//!
//! - [`hatch`]: parallel, zigzag and crossed lines inside closed outlines.
//! - [`grid`]: grids of lines or cells, and lines dividing a box.
//! - [`puzzle`]: jigsaw cut lines or pieces.
//! - [`circles`]: circles that fill a shape without overlapping.
//! - [`shadow`]: the transform of a flat cast shadow.
//! - [`scatter`]: random places for copies inside a container.
//! - [`region`]: the inside of closed outlines and its queries.
//! - [`rng`]: the seeded random numbers the random features share.
