//! The ink channels of a print picture (#1659).
//!
//! A bitmap's pixels are RGB, for the screen. A picture read as CMYK
//! (a `.cdr` CMYK image) also keeps the ink bytes it was read with, so
//! colour separations print each ink as the file holds it: a picture of
//! cyan ink alone prints on the cyan plate alone, black ink alone on the
//! black plate, which a conversion of the screen pixels back to inks
//! cannot promise. The channels belong to the pixels they came with; once
//! the pixels change (an effect, a mode, a resample) they no longer fit
//! and separations convert the pixels instead.
